# qcemu (work-in-progress)
## What is this?
This is a Quantum Computer simulator written in Python 3 for the course `FDD3280 - Quantum Computing to Computer Scientists` at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Part of the code used was shown in class.

## What does this implements?
* Quantum Instructions: HAD, NOT, PHASE, ROTX, ROTY, CNOT, CPHASE, CZ, CCNOT, SWAP and CSWAP;
* Quantum Arithmetic operators;
* Read and write operations, alongside output graphs;
* A domain-specific language (parser) for usage.

## Should I use it?
No. This is a very rudimentary application and this repository serves only for my archival purposes.
